## 🚀 Inspiration

One of our team members is a distance runner on Georgia Tech’s Cross Country and Track team, training nearly every day and traveling frequently for competitions. While on the road, her team has often struggled to identify safe and suitable running routes that avoid frequent stops at traffic lights, high-traffic or unsafe areas, and conditions that could aggravate existing injuries.

## 🎯 What it Does

PathsAcrossAmerica is a web platform that aggregates  walking and running locations across the United States. Users can search by city, ZIP code, or current location to view nearby routes uploaded by other users, including location data, distance, and relevant conditions. Results are ranked based on user-defined preferences (e.g., proximity or surface type). The platform integrates the Google Maps API to provide accurate, real-time mapping and location data.

## 🛠 How we Built it

The application is built in Python using the Django framework following the Model–Template–View (MTV) architecture. It uses a SQLite database to manage user/admin data and store walking and running paths. The Google Maps API is integrated to provide up-to-date mapping and route navigation from a user’s current location to selected paths.
